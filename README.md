INSTRUCTIONS
We would like to create a weather component for our website. This component would be a card with two columns (today & tommorow's weather). 

Each column countains:
-Title ("Today" or "Tommorrow");
-Temperature max(temp2m max);
-Temperature min (temp2m min);
-Weather Description (weather);

The CSS is already created, but the previous developer forgot to center the content inside the card.

TASK 1: Adjust the CSS to center the content inside each columns.

We are using the Machine-readable API (2.2.2) from 7timer to pull weather information.
Here is the documentation: http://www.7timer.info/doc.php#api

Banff geolocation:
-Long: -115.5698
-Lat: 51.1762

7Timer product: CIVIL Light

TASK 2: Connect to the Machine-readable API through an AJAX call.

TASK 3: Populate the weather information automatically inside the React file.

Take as much time as you need and use any tool that would help you acheive this task. And most importantly, have fun :)
